## Task 1 – API Integration Description

This task is part of the Codtech Full Stack Development Internship and focuses on integrating a public API into a web application.

The goal of this task is to demonstrate how to fetch data from an external API and display it dynamically on a webpage. Interns learn to send requests to the API, handle the received JSON response, and update the user interface accordingly.

Key aspects include:
- **API Requests:** Making HTTP requests to fetch data from a public API.
- **Data Handling:** Parsing JSON data and extracting relevant information.
- **Dynamic UI Update:** Using JavaScript to display API data in real-time.
- **Error Handling:** Managing errors such as network failures or invalid input gracefully.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensuring the interface is user-friendly across devices.

Completing this task helps interns understand **client-server communication**, asynchronous programming with `async/await`, and the basics of integrating APIs into modern web applications. It also emphasizes clean code practices, proper commenting, and professional documentation.
